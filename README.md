# Vehicle_Detection_Counting

This project presents a real-time vehicle detection and counting web application that leverages computer vision techniques with an interactive Flask-based interface. The system enables users to upload traffic surveillance videos, which are then processed to detect and count moving vehicles using OpenCVâ€™s background subtraction and contour analysis techniques. A virtual line is defined across the video frame, and whenever a detected object crosses this line, the vehicle count is incremented.
